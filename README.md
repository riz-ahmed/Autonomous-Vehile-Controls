# Autonomous-Vehile-Controls
Remote Git repository for Project "Autonomous vehicle controls". 
Vehicle models and control algorithm are developed using Matlab / Simulink

A linearized vehicle model is developed using a single track model. For this linearized model, a successfull control is implementation starting from the dynamic analysis
